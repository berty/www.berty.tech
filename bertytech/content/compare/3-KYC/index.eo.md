Berty does not need your email address, your phone number, or even your real name (unlike Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp...). To use Berty, all you need is a nickname that will allow you to create a digital self through a Berty ID that is disconnected from the physical self.

ðŸš€ **Benefits:**

- Easy sign in
- Anonymity
- No identity theft issues
- No account hacking issues (email account hack, SIM swapping...)

ðŸ¤¨ **Cons:**

- No easy adding thought email/phone number
- It is not possible to link a Berty ID to a physical person in a compliance context.

 ðŸ’ª **Associated Challenges:**

- Multiple devices sync
- Spread the Berty app as we don't access the device's contact list
