# News #46

Ахой Бертизен! 🏴‍☠️

How's it going?

At Berty's, everyone is doing well. Even if the temperature fell these last days ☁️, we are very motivated because we advance more and more on our Beta. Wanna more details? Read below! Let’s go for the newsletter #46!

Take care of yourself and others 🧡

Ура!

## 🚀 Open Source

We have been working on a lot of different topics over the last two weeks:
* Integrate replication servers in the mobile app
* Nearly finished the orbitdb replay system, to reconstruct the sqlite projection in the mobile app
* Switch to GitHub Actions to build the mobile apps and move the signing step into yolo as an async task
* Adding Darwin support on libp2p tor transport
* Fix UI/UX/Stability fixes and improve the app based on the beta testers' feedback (thanks to them 🙏)
* Refactor go/pkg/bertymessenger to improve maintainability
* Configure backup servers and improve infrastructure monitoring
* Setup xcode-gen on the mobile apps
* Improve the betabot to allow automated onboarding of new beta testers
* Make the bertybridge (mobile native <-> Go) using initutil to initialize ipfs/libp2p like everything else in the project
* Wrote a documentation for self-service onboarding on the beta
