With a strong encryption protocol (E2EE), communicating with Berty is as anonymous as possible (no email or phone number required, with a minimum of metadata). The application is designed to work even without the internet and without a SIM card, through a distributed network. Berty is an anti-surveillance communication tool and is very difficult to censor.
