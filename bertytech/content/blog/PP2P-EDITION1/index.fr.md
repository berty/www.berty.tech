It’s always a big pleasure to participate to convention, but this one is very special to us: we co-founded it and it connects all the Parisian ecosystem. For those who don’t know ParisP2P festival is a convention happening in the heart of Paris and based a simple principals:
* Free for all
* Done by and for the community
* Gather the ecosystem on topic like:
    * décentralisation
    * réseaux et communautés autonomes
    * systèmes distribués et décentralisés
    * applications hors-ligne
    * réseau
    * privacy
    * antisurveillance

    * cryptographie
    * blockchains


As we mentionned, we co-founded the [Edition #0](https://berty.tech/blog/paris-p2p/) in 2020 with our friends from Osmose Collective. That was a dope experience to be all together during 5 days talking about web3 and stuff. So, that was a no brainer to say yes for a next edition. Thanks to the COVID we had to wait 2 years to renew this experience. But, here we go!

## 🖥️ HACKATHON

This year we decided to add a hackathon during the festival. Thanks to all the sponsors, there is a cash price of $10K to win!

The topic given by Berty is a « Game Jam » where participant have to build a mobile game to hide Berty Messenger on mobile! The mission is quite simple:
* Create a simple and light game, which works, and will be used to hide Berty messenger within a phone.
* This game must hide an easter egg, allowing to open the messenger application in a discreet and secure way, when the user wants to do it. It must be complex enough that someone in possession of the phone can play normally without finding the messenger's entrance.
* In settings, users will have to choose to activate this feature.
