# News #36

Hiya!

We'll start without further ado with some news from the staff. Good news: stay-at-home orders have been lifted in France, for now. The whole team is doing well and will continue to work for home. 🏡Literally, we work from the 4 corners of France: from Lille to Corsica, through Normandy and Paris.

We're thinking of changing the newsletter format. The newsletter will be readable on our website and the newsletter will notify you that it is available. This way, we think to avoid having too long emails. Let us know what you think!

We hope you're all doing well too, whatever you are on the globe! Stay safe! 🧡

3...2...1...Boom newsletter #36! 🔥


## 🗣️ Сообщество

* **IPFS Mobile Design Guideline Workshop** We participated in a workshop on mobile designs in the IPFS ecosystem. It was super interesting and great to share experiences. Thanks to Jim, Dietrich, Aaron, and Paul for thinking of us! Let's do it again sometime!

* **Adding document store (WIP)** We have received an external [contribution](https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db/pull/36) for the implementation of a document store on go-orbit-db. Thanks @mentos1386!

* **Good First Issue & Help Wanted** If you want to help us, we have two labels on GitHub to let you know where we need help: [Good First Issue](https://github.com/berty/berty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) & [Help Wanted](https://github.com/berty/berty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). You will have our eternal gratitude and maybe some stickers if you wish. Просто скажите 😏

## 🚀 Open Source

* **Yolo** We are in the process of enhancing our in-house test release system (like TestFlight). The product is evolving well. We are still working on some improvements, such as adding filters. We promise we will make an announcement very soon.

* **Multipeer Connectivity** We released a version of Berty with Multipeer Connectivity enabled by default. It will be available on Yolo (pull 1908).

* **Berty Protocol** We're actively working on improving our protocol. The goal is to drastically reduce metadata to avoid the data matching used by most other messengers that encrypt end-to-end. We can't wait to implement it into the app. Keep in touch!


## 📚 Blog posts

Two articles have been published on the blog. Trust us; they're dope!

* First up is a post about Berty's UX and UI. How to make a 2020 style interface that serves the distributed and decentralized technology at its core?  What are the habits of the users? How can we set a strong first impression? If you want to dive into these psychological hacks, go and have a look at Alex's article: 👉 https://berty.tech/blog/berty-ux-ui/

* Next, we have a rundown of our experience at Paris P2P. Why, how, assessment and consequences. By the way, in 15 days you can join in for the 10th edition! 👉 https://berty.tech/blog/paris-p2p/

* Can you guess the next one? Clue: `25.15.12.15`. _Got it?_

## 🎉 Встреча с командой Berty

For the time being and until further notice, we are canceling all in-person events at public venues. 🚧🚧


* June 3rd, 2020: [Paris P2P #10](https://p2p.paris/en/event/monthly-10/) (Paris, FR 🇫🇷) - _probably replaced by an online event_
