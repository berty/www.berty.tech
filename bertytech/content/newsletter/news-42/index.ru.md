# News #42

Ahoy fellow Bertizens! 🏴‍☠️

Can you believe it's August already? Where'd the summer go? 🤔

We've put together a little recap of our adventures (as we do every couple of weeks).

Before we dive in, we would like to give a warm welcome to all people who opt-in to this newsletter. Thanks for your support!

(_We don't forget those who followed us from the beginning, eh!_ 🧡)

Keep on reading!

## 🚀 Road To Open Beta!

Here is the big news: we are focusing on opening the beta! We're getting more and more messages from people asking us to test the app and see what Berty is going to look like.

We don't really have a specific date, but we defined a roadmap with the necessary steps to test the application. Here are the 5 points/prerequisites we need to set in the next month :
- no need to uninstall the app before installing the new version
- be able to wake up the app when it is in the background.
- improve stability and ensure that no message is lost
- make account QR codes persist
- to have a bot

As you can see, we've got stuff on the grill. 🔥

 We hope that we'll have a "closed" version during September that we'll be able to test with our very close friends to get the first feedback. We hope everything goes well and that we can open the beta to everyone willing to look.
