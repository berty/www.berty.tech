Currently the Berty Protocol won't allow Burn on Read messages. While it is conceptually possible to ask other peers to delete the encryption keys after a message being read, you won't have any guarantee that the other party is not using a modified client, those clients may not comply with those requests.

We will make those features available for people chatting with other normal people, but as soon as you are talking with potentially bad people, you can't have any guarantees.

If you trust your friends, this feature will be useful, else, consider that it's just a visual feature, but not something secure.
