# News #50

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️

Today is newsletter #50! Yeah, *fifty*. 😮  It's a perfect opportunity to tell you how much we sincerely think we have a great community. Thanks for everything. We really appreciate it. 🧡

Some news from the team: The French government has announced a progressive end to the lockdown. Starting tomorrow, we can travel up to 20km (12.5miles) for our baguettes, as long as it takes less than three hours to get back home. (Baguette would probably be stale at that point, anyway. 😉) Shops will reopen, too. If all goes well, we'll be able to spend the holidays with our family.

Masks on. Fingers crossed. 🤞😷

We wish our US friends a Happy Thanksgiving (and tolerable black friday). 🦃🍁

Take care!
