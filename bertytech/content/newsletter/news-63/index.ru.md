# News #63

Hi cool kids üè¥‚ò†Ô∏è

Unlike 15 days ago, it finally feels like summer in France. If you're not in France, close your eyes and imagine sunshine, no clouds, and overheated computers! We hope you can picture our current mood. üåû

Several topics to detail: the EthCC in Paris, the future builders meeting, our progress on Berty...

Enjoy your reading üôÉ


## üöÄ Open Source


### Two past weeks recap

Here's what we've been up to the last few weeks:


* gomobile-ipfs:
    * Fix the release system by replacing Bintray with another platform
    * Continue the integration in Berty
* App:
    * Make all Berty services optional in-app
    * Fix various bugs found by beta-testers
    * investigate and fix the misconfiguration of both Shakebugs and Crashlytics
* Code:
    * Clean up the codebase by removing dead code, unused CI jobs, etc...
    * iOS<->Android BLE driver implementation
    * Keep on improving logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)

### EthCC[4] in Paris

This week was held the EthCC in Paris. The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) is considered the biggest Ethereum event in Europe. The EthCC is organized every year by Ethereum France's association, aiming to promote the understanding and development of Ethereum blockchain technology and, more broadly, blockchain, peer-to-peer, and cryptography technologies.

We were able to participate in several side events like those organized by our friends from SkillZ. It was of very high quality. We'll tell you more about it in a future blog post!


### Berty Builders Meetings

After [Steeve](https://twitter.com/steeve) from Zenly, we are pleased to have [Dietrich](https://twitter.com/dietrich) from Protocol Labs as our next guest.  His talk is entitled "**No Bigger Ship: IPFS and Strategies for Leverage in World-Scale Technology Adoption**". It's quite a topic!

As usual, this event will be live on our [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord). Make sure to join!
