### Funding as an NGO

#### Constraints:

* No selling user data (we don't want to and we can't).
* Free & Open Source application - no revenue.

#### How Berty tackles it:

* We're getting donations from sponsors.
* We plan to crowdfund some tasks, like security audits.

### Being incorruptible / unkillable

#### Constraints:

* Government can force you to add a backdoor in your software.
* Government can force you to give them metadata and messages. This is strictly framed by SBDU in France (anti-terrorism section) and Cloud Act in USA.
* Government can force you to kill the project.
* You must comply with the regulations so you can't be sued.

#### How Berty plans to tackle it:

* Being open-source, so community can freely audit the code to check if any backdoor was added to it.
* Being transparent, not having any secrets that the community doesn't know, so even if Berty Technologies is killed, the community can continue the project.
* Losing control of the release process: we're still thinking about it but the idea is to delegate the release process and validation to the community.
* Allowing other projects to use our protocol: it will add more noise over the network, which is good to make the metadata less useful.
