# Current Work

## Berty V2:

### Bazel & React Native
Guilhem and Norman built and ran a React Native Android Berty app using Bazel for the first time. Woo woo! 🎉

### V2 Screens
Clément (our new recruit) dived into the front part with the help of Godefroy. He is doing well and is starting to set up many of the v2 screens. Soon we will be able to show you the results.👏

### OrbitDB log
Guillaume makes sure that OrbitDB suits our needs and fixes some minor bugs in the go port. Our current work is focused on group member management.

### RoadMap
The entire team edited the roadmap based on a comparison of the front & R&D roadmaps - in order to plan a better overview of all remaining tasks.

### Gomobile-ipfs
We are still brainstorming with the Textile team and have agreed on a gomobile-IPFS architecture. 💪 We can’t wait to show you our work!

## Ops:

### A new video is coming
We partnered with the Samouraï Coop team to produce a video aimed at raising awareness about mass surveillance. The preview is great, we look forward to sharing it with you!

### Paris Open Source Summit
Paris Open Source Summit is Europe's premier event on open source, free software and, open innovation. Pierre submitted our application to the CFP. We hope to be selected!
