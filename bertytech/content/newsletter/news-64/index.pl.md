# News #64

Hi cool kids 🏴☠️

And here is already August. Time flies! A part of the team will be on vacation during the next weeks. We will still be reachable, but not sure to have the time to write the next newsletter. The next one will be maybe at the beginning of September.

We hope you enjoy your vacations if you take some.

In the meantime, here is your Berty digest of the last two weeks.


## 🚀 Open Source


### Two past weeks recap

Here's what we've been up to the last few weeks:

* gomobile-ipfs:
    * Fix the release system by replacing Bintray with another platform
    * Continue the integration in Berty
* App:
    * We are actively working on push notifications. This will allow to test berty in more daily conditions rather than only in quick test mode
    * Make all Berty services optional in-app
    * Fix various bugs found by beta-testers
    * investigate and fix the misconfiguration of both Shakebugs and Crashlytics
* Code:
    * Clean up the codebase by removing dead code, unused CI jobs, etc...
    * iOS<->Android BLE driver implementation
    * Keep on improving logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
