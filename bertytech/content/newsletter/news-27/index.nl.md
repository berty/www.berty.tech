# Huidig werk

A lot of our team members were on vacation but we still have a lot to tell you :smirk:

A new year means new resolutions!

## Tech

### Roadmap Pivot


The first target is to have **a berty-chat app asap**. To achieve this, the chat team is going to work on **v2 of "yolo" release system** and directly use **[go-orbit-db](https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db) and native IPFS node** to create logs and send messages without using the **Berty Protocol**. Then, they will use **[gomobile-ipfs](https://github.com/berty/gomobile-ipfs)** instead of the IPFS node, and finally will switch to the Berty Protocol when the protocol team is ready.

The second objective is to **capitalize the tests of the protocol team**. So, we are going to create a dedicated **Berty Demo** mobile application, directly developed by the protocol team.

### In a nutshell

* Godefroy set up everything (Kanban, issues, deadline...) for the MVP-Chat,
* Clément is implementing stories & styles,
* Guilhem is working on the new Berty Demo service implementation with go-orbit-db; also working on the mobile bridge,
* Guillaume and Antoine are finalizing the initial secret store implementation,
* Alex did a lot of little things for the Paris P2P festival (designing and ordering the badges, banners, worked on the website...).
