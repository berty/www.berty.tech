# News #38

"Bonjour les amis !"

Curious to know what's new at Berty's? You've come to the right place. This week we have a lot of things in store for you, including some screenshots of the Berty app!

As usual, let's start with some news about the team. As they say in Italia: _tuto bene_ 👌. We're very focused on implementing our beta. We can't wait to show you this, and we know you're even more excited. Thank you for all the messages of encouragement we've received. We know you can't wait, so let's hurry!

Without further ado, off we go! 🎈



## 🚀 Open Source


* **Testing Parties**:

Yesterday we had another testing party. To refresh your memory: We're doing live test sessions on Miro. Each member of the team downloads the latest version of the app, and we all join in for live collaboration. We make a big board with lots of QRcodes; it's fun to see! We really can't wait to show you this and do some with you guys!

These sessions allow us to test the correct implementation of the protocol and identify UX features and fixes that we can't see on the sketch files. The front team has added swipe gesture support, for example, to switch between messages to the conversation list quickly. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it supercharges the usability of the application. We're pretty proud!

* **DevTool**:

For our testing sessions, we develop tools that allow us to do batch testing or test faster. Two examples: Send a message to everyone just by pressing a button and share your QR code on Discord. It's excellent for adding everyone on the team! ![](https://i.imgur.com/T7oUDCJ.jpg)


* **Tracing**:

In our last newsletter, we mentioned that we had activated tracing. We'll repeat it: **it's ONLY for our test sessions – it won't work in the real world**. It would be a bit silly to make a privacy-friendly app and start tracing our users... 😏 It's pretty awesome for debugging. You can see who can communicate with whom and jump quickly to networking bugs.

* **IPFS WebUI**:

IPFS WebUI is a web interface to IPFS where you can check on your node stats, explore the IPLD-powered Merkle forest, see peers around the world, and manage your files without needing to touch the CLI. We integrate it in the app to see our peers. It's amazing!
