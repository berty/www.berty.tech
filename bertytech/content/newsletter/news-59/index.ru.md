* Continue implementing iOS<->Android BLE driver
* Continue improving Tor transport and fixing crashes that occurs on libp2p node restart
* Continue gomobile-ipfs integration in Berty
* Investigate white / blank screen that occurs while using app

### Wanna beta Berty?



Loading the upcoming open-beta:  ███████▒ %90

We know that we have been teasing you for a long time about the release of the beta. Well, some lucky members have found the famous secret door on Discord that allows you to test the beta.

But now, we'll go to the next step: what if we told you that it was for next week? 😀😀😀😀


The only thing we can tell you is that the announcement will be made on Discord 🤫. So if you're not there yet, this is the final call 🚀

### An amazing donation for Berty

As good news never comes alone: we have been promised a very significant donation. 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸

We can't tell you who / how much / or how for now. We'll do that through a blog post that will cover everything in great depth. But since we like to be transparent with you, you get the info first. 😉

This donation will officially advance on the berty protocol. More broadly: this donation will secure the future of Berty. And that a f***cking huge news for berty!

We are more than excited (and that's an understatement).

Stay tuned!


### Berty Builders Meetings

We organized a first community meeting last month (thanks TheoXD) and we are planning to organize another one in June. The preset date is June 12th. We would like to do a general talk about the future of p2p. If you're interested, please let us know. All of this has to be confirmed of course. 🗓️

To join the movement: you can register on meetup [https://www.meetup.com/berty-hq/](https://www.meetup.com/berty-hq/). You will have access to future events.
