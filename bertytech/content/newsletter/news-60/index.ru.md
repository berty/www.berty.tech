# News #60

Hi cool kids 🏴☠️

Here’s a newsletter that will make you happy:

Berty is available for iOS on TestFlight 🤩🤩🤩🤩

_and will be soon on the Play Store!_ 


We know we announced in our previous newsletter that it was supposed to arrive last week. But there is a little delay in the validation and some bugs to fix. Anyway, if you have an iPhone, you can download the Alpha! (Read below how!)


Just a quick word about the team before letting you dive into this newsletter: everyone is doing well. Restaurants and bars are finally open again until 11 pm. It feels so good to be back to normal. For sure, we will celebrate the release of our Alpha community in a bar (or two 😇).

We are very excited to showcase our work. Enjoy 😊


## 🚀 Open Source

### Berty Alpha Community

    Alpha is ONLY available on iOS (TestFlight) for now.
    Android version is coming soon.
    Join our Discord to be notified of any news about the Alpha.

**Why a community alpha version?**

We decided to release a community version to open doors to developers and testers, and to push forward on the development. Please note that the app will send data/metadata to third party servers to help developers identify and fix bugs during the Alpha version. It’s only a TEST version to allow community to have testing sessions, explore code,  UX/UI and fix all kinds of bugs.

Our goal with the Alpha Community:
* Every community members can download the Alpha
* This version is not ready for daily usage, it’s just an Alpha version to discover the Berty app.
* TOR feature is not ready yet. IPs are not hidden.
* Account Persistence : not ready yet, your data will probably be lost during updates
* Identify and fix crashes, white screens, app freezes and any other kind of bugs

Ready?

Make sure to join our Discord to know when it's ready. Just saying. 😇
