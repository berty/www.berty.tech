## IPFS CAMP

* Right now, our developers team is in Barcelona at IPFS_CAMP. This workshop brings together IPFS users and allows to share about the new usages of the decentralized Internet. Our team has been selected to present their work on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 🤞. #SOPROUD! We hope everything goes well for them. We promise we'll tell you more about it next week 😉.
