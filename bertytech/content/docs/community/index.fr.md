## 🏠🗺️ Community

*Welcome to the Berty family. We should warn you: it's a pretty big family and our home is the whole world. Wherever you are, we welcome you in.*

*At Berty, we have a true emphasis on our community. You are the driving force behind the project. We are more than ever grateful for the investment of time and effort you have made and will make.*

*Please never underestimate your contribution. Little + Little = Big. We do believe in the _butterfly effect_. Help us fight censorship and mass surveillance, because everyone's privacy matters.*

*Here you will find a comprehensive list of all needed information about the community and a bunch of ideas.*

*Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.*

*The Berty team.*


### 👟 Getting Started

The hardest part is always getting started, and a lot of people are wondering where to start. The answer is very simple: each little thing matters, so just do it!

Here are **5 quick and easy steps** before digging in that will help us a lot:

* Follow [@berty](https://twitter.com/berty) on Twitter.
* Subscribe to our [newsletter](https://berty.tech/newsletter).
* Star Berty on [Github](https://github.com/berty).
* Join the community on [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord).
* Read our [blog posts](https://berty.tech/blog) and [latest news](https://berty.tech/newsletter).

### 🖖 Membership

You can spontaneously decide to become a member. We really encourage all members to become a contributor in any way (see below). We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners.

**Local Ambassadors:** Ambassadors are people who participate in making Berty known on a small but much needed scale. They act as a local referent and they relay technical announcements, events, meetings in your language...

➡️ Join on [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord) to exchange with your local ambassador.

> **Note:** By the way, you could be an ambassador! Simply submit your application on Discord. We're constantly looking for the next amazing ambassador!



### 🎉 Events

We will organize events to bring the community together 🍻. Please let us know if you wish to create local events. We will send you goodies (stickers, T-shirts...), slide kits presenting the project, and relay the info! This applies both for IRL and online events.

> **Note:** If you have other ideas to improve this section, or want to set up an event, go to [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord) and ping @pierre. He is here to help (and he doesn't bite 😏).


## 🤝 Contributing

We really welcome contributions. Your input is the most precious material. We're well aware of that and we thank you in advance. Everyone is encouraged to look at what they can do on their own scale; no effort is too small.

There are plenty of ways to get involved and act for our community. It has been divided into two distinct parts: everything that is related to the code and everything that is not.

> To put it very simply: * Code-related = Github * Not code-related = Open task

Guidelines for each different topic/area:
* [⌨️ Code](#-code)
* [📖 Open Tasks](#-open-tasks)
* [㊗️ Translation](#-translation)
* [🐞Bugs and Report](#-bug-and-report)
* [📞 Support](#-support)
* [✍️ Website & Blog](#-website--blog)



### ⌨️ Code

As you may know, all Berty's code is [open-source](https://berty.tech/blog/open-source/) and available on [Github](https://github.com/berty). The code is yours: `Own it, Use it, Test it, Fix it`.

To facilitate and centralize contributions, we rely only on Github for code contributions. We use `issues` as a discussion forum and contributions can be done in a pull request.

If you're looking for something to get your feet wet working on Berty, take a look at the GitHub issues tagged [`good first issue`](https://github.com/berty/berty/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/berty/berty/labels/help%20wanted).

Here is a bunch of contribution ideas:
* Answer the questions from the community on issues.
* Fix bugs reported on issues.
* Send us a pull request.
* Review the existing pull request.
* Improve the documentation.
* Check out the architecture and review it.
* Hack on Berty.
* Contribute to the projects of the Berty ecosystem (mostly IPFS-related).
* Any other form of contribution that is not mentioned above. 😬


See [README](https://github.com/berty/berty) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.

### ㊗️ Translation

As you may guess, we don't know every language. However, we want Berty to be accessible to as many people as possible. That's why we need as much material as possible translated into as many languages as possible.

This can be the documentation, the app, the support, a blog post, even this page, or another section on the site.

### 🐞 Bugs and Report

We use GitHub issues for tracking requests and bugs. Please post the questions directly there using the 'bug' tag.

If you've got questions or issues with using Berty, check out our support page and be sure to connect to our community, where there's always someone ready to help.

### 📞 Support

For Berty to benefit as many people as possible, it is important to have the most comprehensive documentation available. If you have a question and the answer is not in the documentation/support page, please help us to update this section.

Remember, if you have asked yourself the question, someone else will do the same.

> To help us improve our support page, reach @Camille.
