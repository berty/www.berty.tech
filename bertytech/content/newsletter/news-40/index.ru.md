# News #40

Ahoy! 🏴‍☠️

Quick notice before we move on to the news:

#### ❕ Urgent appeal for collaboration to fight censorship in Hong Kong

> We are in a hurry to move forward more quickly because of situations like the ones in Hong Kong. Our privacy is at more risk than ever. If you are impacted in any way by this situation, please [contact us](https://berty.tech/contact). We'd like to see how Berty can help. Good luck to you!

As usual, a word about the team: Everything's going well. Yesterday some members even met in Paris in our offices for the first time in a long time. Things are getting back to normal. We hope things are improving for you, too.

Without further ado, here's your digest of berty's shiny new things for the last two weeks. Enjoy!


## 🚀 Open Source


* **Testing Parties**:
    * We continue our regular testing games. We have greatly improved the stability of the application. Well... okay, there's still some kinks to work out, but we're getting close.
    * For the record: Yesterday's testing party was original. We were between Paris, South of France and Greece at the same time! You could say: We are _decentralizing_ our testing! 😉

* **Group Conversation Feature**:
    * The front team is integrating the Group chatroom feature. We can't wait to test it and turn a conversation thread into a party with the whole team 🎈


## 🗣️ Сообщество

* Thanks to [@Jonyet](https://github.com/jonyet) for his contribution!

* **Good First Issue & Help Wanted**: If you want to help us, we have two labels on GitHub to let you know where we need help: **Good First Issue** & **Help Wanted**. You will have our eternal gratitude and maybe some stickers if you wish. Просто скажите 😏




## 🎉 Встреча с командой Berty

До дальнейшего уведомления мы отменяем все личные мероприятия в общественных местах, но скоро мы подойдем к экрану рядом с вами! 🚧🚧
