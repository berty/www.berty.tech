# News #68 🎃👻

Hi dear friends,

So without further ado, here is your digest!

* Clean up the codebase by removing dead code, unused CI jobs, etc...
* Keep on fixing various bugs found by beta-testers

* Continue gomobile-ipfs integration in Berty


## 🚀 About the Berty ecosystem


### 🗣️ React Native Expert Developer Position @Berty


We're looking for a real UX ninja, pixel-perfect focused, to join us on the front side of the app.

He/she will work:
* on main UX/UI features implementations,
* be focused on optimizations and bugs,
* optimize in-app animations,
*  and more globally all performance we can!


**Main stack:** React Native

So if you're used to Github and highly motivated to contribute to an open-source project protecting privacy, which will be released in upcoming weeks, drop us an email!

The mission is a minimum of 2 months but can be extended to a long-term contract since our team has been here for years! It's a full-time & full remote!  You'll be free to work in the timezone you want by having regular & daily chats with zôÖma & the team on Berty discord server.




### New Blog post

We wrote a new article a few weeks ago but forgot to mention it in this newsletter, so here it is. It is our opinion on the possible misuse of Berty.
