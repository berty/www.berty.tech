# News #62

Hi cool kids 🏴☠️

We don't know about you, but it's not like the previous summers here in France. The weather is not very nice, and it rains a lot... ☔

Hmm, you are not reading this newsletter to get the weather, are you? 😅 So, let's jump in for your dose of information about Berty!


## 🚀 Open Source


### Two past weeks recap

Here's what we've been up to the last few weeks:

* Cleaning up the codebase by removing dead code, unused CI jobs, etc...
* Automating connection between Tyber and mobile apps for debugging
* Fixing various bugs found by beta-testers
* Implementing iOS<->Android BLE driver
* Improving logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
* Continue gomobile-ipfs integration in Berty
* Investigate and fix the misconfiguration of both Shakebugs and Crashlytics
