A centralized model cannot work without a server. It belongs to and depends on an entity that controls all the information that passes through it. What happens if this identity is malicious? Or if it is threatened by a third party or simply hacked? Our personal data cannot be truly protected if it is dependent on a single identity. If a government decides to isolate a country and cut off the internet, the centralized system becomes non-functional. To avoid all this, for Berty we have chosen a free network which does not depend on any entity or government.
