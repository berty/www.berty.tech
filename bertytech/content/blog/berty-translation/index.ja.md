TL; DR: Help us to translate the Berty app & website using a platform called Crowdin. https://translate.berty.community


# Why Translating?

## You speak English? Lucky you!

According to [Babbel](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-english-and-where-is-it-spoken#:~:text=Out%20of%20the%20world's%20approximately,English%20as%20their%20first%20language.), about 360 million people speak English as their first language. And many more people read/talk English: about 20% of the world's population or 1.5 billion people. It is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world.

This is one of the reasons why we communicate almost exclusively in English. To spread our message massively. Whereas in real life, we are Frenchies, frogs and baguette eaters (#clich√©).

However, be aware of one thing: If you read this article in its original version, i.e., in English, you are lucky! You have access to knowledge and information!

The other side of the coin is that 80% of the population will not have knowledge (of Berty, for example) simply because of the language.

Help us to change this!

> And the good news is you don't have to be a developer!


# How To Contribute to Berty Translation?

As Berty continues to grow, it needs to support more and more languages. Managing all that in the source code will become very hard and prone to errors. Luckily there's an easy solution to that, and it's called Crowdin!

## Translate with Crowdin

Crowdin is an online platform that allows you to do translations through a visual interface. It is possible to designate people as translators for any natural language. After downloading the source strings, the translators can get to work. They will be notified as soon as there is something new to translate. When they are finished, approvers can begin proofreading using some of the extensive quality assurance features. It is impossible to miss a translation, as it will be clearly marked as not translated. Strings that are removed from the source file will also be removed from all translations. Translated files can be uploaded at any time and will be in precisely the same format as the source file. In other words, clean and up-to-date translation files!

Small information for developers: integration with Git repository or a CLI tool can get the source strings in Crowdin.

> We take this opportunity to thank Crowdin from the bottom of our hearts because they offered us their solutions because we are an NGO and open source (and nope, this article is not sponsored!). üß°üôè
