## Ops:

### Paris P2P #3
This week (just like every first Wednesday of the month) we went to [ParisP2P](https://p2p.paris/en/event/monthly-3/). It's really fantastic to meet passionate and exciting people every time.  P2P + Beer 🍺 + Pizza 🍕 is the perfect combo <3

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the participants for their constructive feedback on Berty.

Thank you, ParisP2P, and see you next month!
