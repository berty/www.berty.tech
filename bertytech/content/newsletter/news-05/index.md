## WORK IN PROGRESS

This week, the tech team is still working hard on the Network. That explained why Berty's preview version only works in local for now. We hope to fix that asap!

We are working on a new design for the app 🤫 Stay tuned!

The Ops team finished working on the Cryptography Exports! Next step is to be reviewed by a lawyer. We hope to submit this application before August.

We participated in OSMOSE hackathon last weekend. We spoke a lot about synergies between Berty and other organizations. Hot stuff coming, but we can't tell you more yet!
