    title: "Berty is&nbsp;**distributed**."
    text: >
      Unlike other mainstream applications (think WhatsApp and Signal), Berty doesn’t have a central server, which could be used to monitor your messages. Instead, you communicate directly, without any need for a third party.
      With Berty, you can’t be monitored, you can’t be censored, and you don’t need to pay any server operating costs - with either your money or your data.

    title: "Berty uses&nbsp;**end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default**."
    text: >
      End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is intended to prevent data from being read or modified by anyone other than the sender and recipient(s). Unlike Telegram and Messenger, it's activated by default in the Berty app. That means no third parties - like your telecom provider, internet service provider, or even Berty - can eavesdrop on your conversations.

    title: "Berty does&nbsp;**not need a KYC (Know Your Customer)**."
    text: >
      Berty doesn’t ask for your email address, phone number, or real name - setting it apart from most messaging apps, like Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp. To create a digital Berty ID, you just need to provide a name (real, fake, or a nickname).

      With zero data collected about you, Berty offers complete anonymity, an easy sign-in, and ultimate confidence. There’s no possibility of identity theft or account hacking, like email hacking and SIM swapping

      Berty is open-source. That means anyone can contribute, verify, audit, and copy Berty’s source code. There’s nothing to hide, no license fees, and no need to use official app stores.

    title: "Berty&nbsp;**protects your metadata**&nbsp;as well."
    text: >
      A messaging app might not be able to read the contents of your message (the data), but it will collect vital information about that message (the metadata), like when it was sent and who it was sent to. By compiling metadata, powerful insights can be drawn about you.

      Unlike other apps, Berty’s not interested in your private life - in fact, Berty doesn’t want to know anything about you. That’s why Berty reduces metadata collection to the minimum possible amount.

    title: "Berty is&nbsp;**not based on a blockchain**."
    text: >
      Like blockchain, the Berty Protocol is peer-to-peer, and therefore distributed and decentralized. However, unlike blockchain, the Berty Protocol doesn’t require a consensus or validation by the network. That’s because data on the Berty Protocol is all stored locally, and there’s no historic recording in an open ledger. It also means there aren’t any transaction fees for each data exchange.

      Berty is designed to be bulletproof to the future. It’s a protocol that works on Mars, as well as in the most extreme network conditions on Earth.
      Berty allows users to communicate and create autonomous local networks without an internet connection or a SIM card, using [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) (BLE) and [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).

      Privacy is a fundamental right, not one you should pay for. That’s why Berty Technologies is a non-profit organization. The Berty app will always be 100% free, prioritize privacy over commercial interest, and serve the community - not shareholders.
      To power innovative development, Berty Technologies relies on donations and community support

        Berty Technologies is a French non-profit and NGO founded in July 2018 in response to the urgent need for truly secure, readily usable online messaging. **Berty Technologies built Berty, a full-featured mobile messaging application, and Berty Protocol, the freestanding secure messaging technology behind it.**

        Berty Technologies collaborates with like-minded advocacy and engineering movements to fight back against threats to online privacy. Surveillance and personal data collection technologies are constantly evolving, and so must Berty.

      text: >
        Berty Technologies advocates these beliefs through its products, outreach, and partnerships.
        - **The right to private digital communication is universal.** Berty’s tools are offered freely, with no distinction between individuals, groups, public organizations, or private organizations.
        - **Privacy should be the easy option.** Berty must be as easy to use as, if not easier than, competitors.
        - **Transparency is a strength that no secretive authority can outpace.** The code behind Berty is 100% open-source, and anyone with the right skills and mindset can follow, test, and contribute to codebase and advocacy work. The integrity of Berty lies in the fact that power sits firmly in the hands of contributors and users.
        - **No voice should be lost to censorship.** Berty Technologies develops for extremely adverse use cases. Whether it’s internet blackouts, autocratic regimes, or civilian street protest suppression, Berty works. Reliably. With or without an internet connection. Always.
        - **The decentralized “future” starts today.** Central relay points, be they governments or big tech server farms, keep power concentrated at the top. The technology to decentralize this power exists today - the Berty Protocol is peer-to-peer, guaranteeing that authorities can’t gain access to your personal information.
        - **You should steal this code.** Any organization or individual that wants to support user anonymity can, and should, use the Berty Protocol.
        - **France is a thriving hub of security technology.** Berty Technologies is committed to increasing the dynamism and competitiveness of the French technology sector, particularly in cryptography, distributed networks, cybersecurity, and emerging protocols.

        **Berty Technologies was founded by  [Manfred Touron](https://twitter.com/moul), a cybersecurity specialist, cryptography engineer**, and authority on decentralization technologies and internet privacy rights. Observing the dangers to civilian privacy posed by the use of current messaging applications, Berty was created to stand up to these threats.

        In the organization’s early days, engineers worked to understand where they could make the biggest impact, conducting research and intentional outreach. As a result, **Berty Technologies grew a reputation as an exciting, up-and-coming player in the decentralized Web3 movement, winning the OMG feature @ IPFS Camp (Barcelona, 2018)**. Berty Technologies now stands as a talented, remote-first team of 12.

        Committed to the principles of open-source and decentralization, Berty values transparency and collective interest, rejecting the traditional hierarchical model adopted by most commercial enterprises. They spearhead this culture of decentralized innovation, meeting external challenges and opportunities as soon as they emerge, rather than waiting until they reach company executives.
