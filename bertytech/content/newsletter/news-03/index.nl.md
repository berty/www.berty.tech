## Feedback from IPFS Camp

 As I mentionned in our previous newsletter, the Dev Team attended at IPFS Camp in Barcelona! During this stay, a lot of things has happened. Let's me tell you more:

### NEWS COLLABORATION

 Summits are always an opportunity to meet new teams and people. IPFS Camp was no exception. They met, in particular, the teams of Textile (for the mobile part) and Peergos (for the cryptography part on a distributed system). The entire Berty team is looking forward to work with them again and to see the incredible results we will achieve at the end! 😉
