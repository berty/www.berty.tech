This is an important commitment for us: we think that privacy is a fundamental right and that there should be no commerce around it. That's probably the main reason why we have chosen to be a non-profit organization (NPO). It's the best way to show the world that we have nothing to sell - because we couldn't make anything from it anyway.

- Berty is free and will always be!
- Privacy-focused, without ANY concession.
- Berty is truly built for the community.

ðŸ¤¨ **Cons:**
