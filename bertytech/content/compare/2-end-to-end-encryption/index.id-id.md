![Berty uses End To End Encryption (E2EE) by default.](photo-1588689653688-9b312cd6bc2b.jpeg)

End-to-endÂ encryption (E2EE) is intended to prevent data from being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). Unlike Telegram & Messenger, it's activated by default in the Berty app.

ðŸš€ **Benefits:**

- Data protection: no third parties can decipher the data being communicated or stored
- Prevents potential eavesdroppers including your telecom providers, your ISP and even us as providers of the communication service

ðŸ¤¨ **Cons:**

- It is not possible to inspect the content, even in the context of regulations and compliance.

 ðŸ’ª **Associated Challenges:**

- Man-in-the-middle attacks
