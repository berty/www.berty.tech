# News #55

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️

We're back!

Sorry for this interruption of more than a month without news from Berty. We've been pretty busy lately. Mainly because we've been responding to a big RFP. We can't say much about it right now but it would be great news for Berty!

As usual: the little word on the team. Everyone is doing well - except for Clement who was injured during a track and field practice. We won't send you the picture but his ankle has doubled in size! We need our front-end developer back soon!  Send him lots of positive vibes.

In other news: we're getting ready to go off-site for a week. We are looking forward to meet again after these long months without seeing each other.

Without further ado, here is your dose of info on Berty.
