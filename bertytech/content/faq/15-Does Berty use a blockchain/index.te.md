No, Berty doesn't use a blockchain. The reason is straightforward: Blockchains need consensus, the Internet, and wait times for validation — the things we wanted to avoid in Berty. Above all, blockchains are much more suitable for validating transactions without a central authority than for exchanging messages anonymously.

Berty is build with the Wesh protocol. In the end, Wesh is very different from blockchain. The Wesh Protocol is built with the “no-consensus” philosophy from start to finish, and it can operate without Internet access.
