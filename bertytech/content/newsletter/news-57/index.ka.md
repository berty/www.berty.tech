# News #57

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️

Hope the winds are favorable on your end.

All good here – we're healthy, hard at work, and excited to show off some screenshots (scroll 👇). These are live for beta testers, and later this year, for everyone!

...Oh, and by the way, did you find the secret door? 🚪

See you soon, friends! 😉


## 🚀 Open Source

Here's what we've been up to the last few weeks:


* Implementing the iOS<->Android BLE driver
* Improving OrbitDB: encrypt next links, optimize entry serialization and payload size
* Developing the Nearby driver for iOS
* Tightening up logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
* Tor transport improvements and nixing crashes that occur on libp2p node restart
* Improvements on gomobile-ipfs integration in Berty
* Refactor and improvements on tinder: filtering and wiring on event bus
* Investigating some 4G performance issues with libp2p/IPFS
* Performing some exploratory surgery to diagnose the frequent freezes of the Android app
* Adding more error traces for our Tyber debugging tool
