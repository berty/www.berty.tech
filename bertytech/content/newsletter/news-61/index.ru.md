# News #61

Hi cool kids üè¥‚ò†Ô∏è

In this newsletter, you will find an update on the progress of our alpha version, a summary of our Builders Meeting #1, our classic report of the last weeks.

Have a pleasant reading :)


## üöÄ Open Source

### Berty Alpha Community

    Alpha is ONLY available on iOS (TestFlight) for now.
    Android version is coming soon.
    Join our Discord to be notified.

And it's been two weeks since Berty launched the alpha community version. We are delighted. Thanks for your feedback and bug reports; believe us, it helps us.

Thanks also for your support messages. You guys are great.


Regarding the android version: We are still waiting for the Android Play Store validation. It's a bit more complicated: we have to implement different things in the application, like pops up to inform about the use of location for BLE. It's taking a while, but everything should be fine soon.


**How to download?**

Join us on [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord), check out our announcement channel to get all the info to download the alpha. And if you have an Android phone, we are as impatient as we are. It's a matter of days now.

Make sure to join our Discord to know when it's ready‚Äîjust saying. üòá



### two past weeks recap

Here's what we've been up to the last few weeks:

* Fix various bugs found by beta-testers
* Integrate p2p-circuit v2 (experimental) to see if there are any improvements
* Investigate the abnormally slow reception of multiple messages on Berty Messenger
* Implement Tyber network bridge on a mobile app
* Implement iOS<->Android BLE driver
* Improve logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
* Integrate gomobile-ipfs in Berty
