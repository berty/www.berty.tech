IPFS is a protocol + peer-to-peer network developed by Protocol Labs. The mission of this software is to democratize the distributed internet. The principle of IPFS is to set up a shared hard drive, while also ensuring immutability. It is more resilient and can also work without the internet.

Berty's protocol is based on IPFS.
