# Go-IPFS-Log

**Go version of append-only log CRDT on IPFS**

## Introduction

[ipfs-log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log/) was originally created for [orbit-db](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) - a distributed peer-to-peer database on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs). This library intends to provide a fully compatible port of the JavaScript version in Go.

The majority of this code was vastly derived from the JavaScript's [ipfs-log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log) library.
