# News #45

Ahoy Bertizen! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

We are happy to see more of you checking out our newsletter + website. Thanks for the support everyone! üß°

As usual, a few quick words about the team: All in all, everything is going well. We're playing it safe and working remote if we have the least suspicion of virus exposure (we're all getting used to it by now!).

Enough about us, let's go for the newsletter. Take care of yourself and others.

Cheers!

## üöÄ Open Source

A quick recap of what we've been focused on for the last two weeks:

- ***Bot***: This week, we set up a bot to quickly build real-world scenarios for beta testers setting up their accounts. Testing the Berty application without a contact list, for example, will not give them a complete picture (thank you captain obvious)! It's a necessary tool and we hope it will work well.
- ***Crashlytics and Shake***: To have a successful beta, we need to make bug reports effortless for testers so we can hop on them quickly. That's why we're rolling out Crashlytics and Shake. This will make it dead easy for you to show us errors in-situ.
- ***Stability and performance***: Our progress is too detailed to go into here, but we will not compromise on this point. To this end, we're working on the implementation of replication relays: We need peers with better uptime + fewer network/performance constraints than the mobile app to ensure high availability. We therefore expect that Berty Desktop users will take on this role and that the user community will set up servers/highly available peers with the sole purpose of helping the network.
- ***In-app notifications***: As you may know already, notifications can be a source of metadata leakage. It's something we're hypervirgilant about. On the other hand, a messaging application without notifications could be a tough sell! For now, we're thinking about notifications optional in our first public release. We'll keep you posted.
- ***Go-Tor-Transport***: As announced in our previous newsletter, Jorropo joined our team to provide anonymised access to the libp2p network. Jorropo is well settled in the team now and has already made a lot of contributions.You can check his work here:
