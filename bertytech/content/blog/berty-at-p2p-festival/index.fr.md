# Berty at Paris P2P Festival #0


As announced in our previous [blog post](https://berty.tech/blog/paris-p2p-festival/), we had the pleasure to co-organize the very first [Paris P2P Festival](https://p2p.paris/fr/event/festival-0/) from January 8 to 12, 2020 in Paris. This event was a true opportunity to bring together peer-to-peer enthusiasts and people curious about open source in general. These were 5 intense days of sharing, learning and chance encounters!

TLDR: We had a blast! ü§©

This festival was truly peer-to-peer!


### Ground Control

We benefited from an ideal setting located in a former postal sorting hall - [Ground Control](https://www.groundcontrolparis.com/), a food court offering a gigantic space! This site     allowed us to define all the different spaces needed for the event.

## Berty at P2P Festival #0

Members of the Berty team had discussions with many very interesting people: exchanges with people from the legal, political and technical world with their own projects. We had the chance to talk to activists who want to use Berty to protect their communication, as well as with journalists. It was so interesting and rewarding to realize that Berty can be used by so many diverse people.
