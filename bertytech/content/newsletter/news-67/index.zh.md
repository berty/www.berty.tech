# News #67

Hey

Today we have prepared a newsletter with a lot of information... because we have a lot of news (and juicy information) to share with you.

So no lengthy introduction; let's dive in for your dose of info on Berty.

To tease you into clicking: among other things, a considerable donation to advance our protocol, a video shoot, and the progress on the application.

## üöÄ About the Berty ecosystem

### üó£Ô∏è Announcement: NODLE GRANTS BERTY 1 MILLION IN NODLE CASH

We mentioned it in one of our previous newsletters, but we can officially tell you: **Berty has received a donation of one million dollars from [Nodle](https://nodle.io/)**. üéâ

After IPFS, Nodle joins Berty's official donor list. Nodle's teams have decided to support Berty to advance our p2p communication protocol. As we share a common interest in BLE, we're excited to work together to build a new p2p standard for privacy! Needless to say, this is excellent news for our organization, for the whole ecosystem, and the community. üî•

> üí° Funds will be locked for 2 years and will be dedicated to the future of the foundation development.

### üé• Video Shoot

Last week we had the opportunity to shoot a short documentary about Berty. We can't tell you more for now, nor when it will be released. The only thing we can say to you is that it was a fantastic experience. The shooting crew was incredibly nice. It allowed us all to get together in Paris for a couple of days. We hadn't seen each other for a long time, and it was so dope. üî•

The Paris P2P (reborn edition) took place last week. It was the occasion to see friends IRL again. The program was simple: free for all and beer2beer. We took the opportunity to do a testing session of the Berty application and shoot some nice images for the documentary. We'll try to do it again next month! Thanks to those who came.
