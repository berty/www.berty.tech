# News #41

Ahoy! 🏴‍☠️

Are you ready for newsletter number 41?

We hope you're doing very well, getting away from your screen to bask in the sun once in a while if you're in the northern hemisphere – keeping yourself and others safe, of course. 😷

As usual, a word about the team: Everybody's fine. It's summer, and some of the team members are (or have been) on vacation. We're increasingly frequenting our headquarters in Paris - although, for the moment, we're still home office first.

Without further ado, here's your digest of berty's shiny new things for the last two weeks. Enjoy! 🧡


## 🚀 Open Source


* **Berty Protocol**: The big topic we've been working on lately is the application's stability. This week we wrote some test scenarios (e2e & integration tests). We hope to fix this soon and show you this!

* **Testing Parties**: As you probably know, we have weekly testing parties. Last week we were able to test the **group chat** for the first time. We had the whole team in a single conversation to test out this feature – pretty sweet.



## 🗣️ Community

* **Community Forum**: It may be a little early to tell you about it, but since you're our favorites, we can't resist. We are currently adding a forum for the community. It is directly linked to the berty website and allows us to have a comment system (blog/newsletter). Sign up and give us your feedback. It will be very much appreciated!

The forum is here: 👉 https://berty.community/ _(it couldn't be simpler: berty + community!)_




* **Good First Issue & Help Wanted**: If you want to help us, we have two labels on GitHub to let you know where we need help: **Good First Issue** & **Help Wanted**. You will have our eternal gratitude and maybe some stickers if you wish. Just saying 😏




## 🎉 Meet the Berty Crew

Until further notice, we are canceling all in-person events at public venues – but we're coming soon to a screen near you! 🚧🚧

* October 21-23, 2020: [PWG 2020](https://www.planetiers.com/worldgathering/)



## 📚 Blogposts

There is a brand new article on the blog! We just published it today. Our friend Zooma wrote on **10 good reasons to use Berty**. You're about to find out why "dictators hate us"!
