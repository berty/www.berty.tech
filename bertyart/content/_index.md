  faq_intro: Support freedom of speech by combining street art and whistle blowers
  q_1: Why this project ?
  a_1: Our goal is to raise public awareness about privacy issues, in order to raise awareness and encourage everyone to preserve their data.
  q_2: What's the common point between street art, privacy and whistle blowers ?
  a_2: "Rather than talking about figures or stating facts that have been at the heart of debates for several years, we have chosen to pay tribute to the women and men who first sounded the alarm. Street art is a unifying art where the public space becomes a place of expression, where the work is offered to the passer-by whether he is rich, poor, young or old, it is an ideal vector of the values we defend. Thus by choosing to associate ourselves with artists our goal was twofold, to make known whistleblowers for the most part unknown, but also to support these artists who are committed to the freedom to communicate freely. Thus by choosing to display their portraits in cities in full view of everyone, we want to arouse the curiosity of passers-by, so that they wonder who is the subject of the portrait and that their curiosity leads them a little further and pushes them to read the biography of the whistleblower."
  q_3: Who are the whistle blowers ?
  a_3: "Sometimes described as heroes, sometimes as criminals, some names are familiar to us because their revelations have resounded to the four corners of the globe: Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, etc ... <br/>Some names, however, escape this notoriety which would be - if not the least of the things with regard to the risks they may have taken for the common good - their only protection against companies or states whose interests they may have compromised.<br/>To make them and their struggle known is to offer them protection, recognition, and to ensure that their struggle is not in vain. From the most notorious to the most unknown, whether they are American or African, European or Asian, they all seem to answer the same thing: A citizen indignant by what he witnessed, and of which he did not want to keep the secret.<br/>In fact, it could have been any of us, as long as we had the courage to put society's interests ahead of our own.<br/><a class='js-scroll-trigger' href='#whistle-blowers'>Check out the whistleblower list</a>"
  q_4: Who is behind the project ?
  a_4: Berty Technologies is a non-profit organization whose mission is to develop tools to improve people's lives. We are a team of passionate people and we develop a secure distributed messaging application, so that everyone can communicate easily and freely while keeping control of their data.
