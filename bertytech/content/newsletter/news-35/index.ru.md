# News #35

Oh, wait, what? A Berty news on Thursday? What's going on?

Don't worry, we're fine. It's just that tomorrow is International Workers' Day, which is a holiday in France. It's kind of ironic that workers' day is an off day, isn't it?

As usual, fresh news from the team: Everyone's fine. We hope you're okay too! We're all looking forward to going out again, grab a beer, and getting back to our healthy lives. As we've been doing for the last 6 weeks (since you're locked in), we're focused on the MVP. We got news for you.

Here is goes for News #35!

### IPFS Community Call

This week, we participated in the IPFS Community Call. Antoine presented the latest news of our work on Gomobile-IPFS. The good news is that the gomobile-ipfs demo app is available on Yolo! If you're wondering what Yolo is, go a little further down the news.

So, a huge clap for Antoine and a warm thanks to IPFS for allowing us to present this work. _And also, we are sorry for being late due to some UTC sync troubles (grrr)_.

The video will be updated on IPFS Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdjsUXJ3QawK4O5L1kqqsew

### The Makair Project

We wanted to present to you a project that is meaningful to us: Makair.

What's Makair? It is an artificial respirator exclusively dedicated to the treatment of Covid-19. The particularity is that it is an open-source artificial respirator easily reproducible at a low cost.

So just "bravo" and respect to our friend @waxzce and all other people involved in this project! 🧡

### Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for Berty

PhilH, a co-organizer of FranceP2P, opened an interesting issue on berty/community about a Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Berty.

These questions are so complex that it is essential that they are thought out well in advance, to be able to anticipate, schematize all types of governance attacks, etc BEFORE the project is potentially "known" and under the spotlight.

Thanks to PhilH for its help, and thanks to all those who will take the time to participate in the debate!

Yolo is a one-stop real-time feed of ready-to-install releases and tests for your apps. Мы используем его на предприятии, чтобы подготовить выпуски и тестовые ветки для загрузки и использования на устройстве разработчика в течение нескольких минут после прохождения нашего CI.

We created Yolo to implement the critical features missing from Apple's TestFlight.

### Multipeer Connectivity driver


Last [news](https://berty.tech/newsletter/news-34/), we told you that Remi linked `Multipeer Connectivity driver` to the v1 of Berty.

This news, we are pleased to tell you: he strikes again! He made the same thing for the current codebase 🎉
