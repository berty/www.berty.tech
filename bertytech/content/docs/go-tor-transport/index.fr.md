# Go-Tor-Transport

**Go and C tor binary builtin transport for libp2p, aiming to provide anonymised access to the libp2p network.**


## Introduction

[go-tor-transport](https://github.com/berty/go-tor-transport) is a transport proving access to an libp2p network through the tor network.

To do that the code mainly uses [go-libtor](https://github.com/ipsn/go-libtor) to provide a go linking of the [Tor's](https://www.torproject.org/) node.

So at the start it either connects to a node running in system or start his own one embed in the binary, so usage can be seemless as possible.
