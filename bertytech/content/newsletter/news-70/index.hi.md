# News #70

Hey

How are you doing? Are you slowly getting ready for Christmas, or is it the traditional end-of-year rush?

At Berty, things are getting faster! We still have in mind to be ready for release at the beginning of Q1 2022. We are on the right track. 😉

Without too many technical details, the Berty application presently has some minor stability issues over time. For example, when a conversation is too important (=with a lot of texts & data), the loading time is relatively slow to be usable on a daily basis. We are fixing this in the next couple of days.


## 📱 App progress recap

Here's what we've been up to over the past few weeks:
- Set up an automatic build and upload on stores
- Keep on integrating push notification in Berty mobile apps
- Fix gomobile-ipfs release system by replacing Bintray with another platform
- Fix various bugs found by beta-testers
- Implement iOS<->Android BLE driver
- Improve logging and reduce verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
