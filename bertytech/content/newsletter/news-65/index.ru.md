# News #65

Wazzzaaaaaaaa


We hope you're good :)

As some people noticed, there was no newsletter last week. The reason is quite simple: our ops team was on vacation. Next week it's the technical team's turn. (For our more detail-oriented readers, you can notice that there are still crew members on the ship. 🏴☠️)

Without further ado, here is your Berty digest!

## 🚀 Open Source


### Two past weeks recap

Here's what we've been up to over the past few weeks:
* Integrate push notifications into Berty's mobile apps.
* Make all Berty services optional in the application
* Fix the gomobile-ipfs release system by replacing Bintray with another platform.
* Investigate and correct the misconfiguration of Shakebugs and Crashlytics.
* Clean up the codebase by removing dead code, unused CI jobs, etc...
* Continue to fix various bugs found by beta testers.
* Implement the iOS<->Android BLE driver
* Improve logging and reduce verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
* Continue the integration of gomobile-ipfs in Berty
* Redesign the navigation with a switch to native mode to improve performance and respect the user interface specific to the platform.

### Berty Builders Meetings

A few weeks ago, we had the pleasure of welcoming Dietrich from Protocol Labs. If you have missed it, we uploaded his lecture online a few days ago.  It's the perfect opportunity to learn a lot about internet browsers, web3, IPFS, and a lot of other exciting things. (oh, and if you have seen it, don't hesitate to watch it again 😉)
