# Berty au Festival de Paris P2P #0


Comme annonc√© dans notre pr√©c√©dent [billet de blog](https://berty.tech/blog/paris-p2p-festival/), nous avons eu le plaisir de co-organiser le tout premier [Festival de Paris P2P ](https://p2p.paris/fr/event/festival-0/) du 8 au 12 janvier 2020 √† Paris. Cet √©v√©nement a √©t√© une v√©ritable opportunit√© de r√©unir les passionn√©s du peer-to-peer et des personnes curieuses de l'open source en g√©n√©ral. Ce furent 5 jours intenses de partage, d'apprentissage et de rencontres fortuites !

TLDR: Nous nous sommes √©clat√©s ! ü§©




## Festival P2P #0

![](conference.jpg) Nous avons eu le plaisir d'accueillir 73 conf√©renciers venus du monde entier pour couvrir les 96 √©v√©nements du festival. Les sujets abord√©s vont de la communication s√©curis√©e, du partage de connaissances, de la gouvernance participative et des monnaies num√©riques, √† l'art et au mentalisme.

Quelle programme ! ü§Ø Have a glimpse below üëá

This festival was truly peer-to-peer!


### Ground Control

We benefited from an ideal setting located in a former postal sorting hall - [Ground Control](https://www.groundcontrolparis.com/), a food court offering a gigantic space! This site     allowed us to define all the different spaces needed for the event.

## Berty at P2P Festival #0

Members of the Berty team had discussions with many very interesting people: exchanges with people from the legal, political and technical world with their own projects. We had the chance to talk to activists who want to use Berty to protect their communication, as well as with journalists. It was so interesting and rewarding to realize that Berty can be used by so many diverse people.
