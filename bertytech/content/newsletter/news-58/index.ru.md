How is the Berty Family doing?

On our side, things are going well. We're pretty focused right now, which is great.  Berty is progressing well, especially on the android part, which was a bit late. We know how impatient you are to test Berty, and we promise to work hard on it. We plan to put a public roadmap - which will show the progress of the work and the blocking points before the next steps. We hope you'll like it and we'll talk to you soon.

Without futher ado, let jump in our dose of Berty News!

### Berty Builders Meetings

As we announced in a special newsletter last week, we have created a new Rendez-Vous: the Builders' Meetings. üë∑

These events were designed with a single purpose in mind: to show you what the community is doing with Berty and its protocol.

This first meeting was hosted by TheoXD and members of the Berty team. Theo presented VoteID: a decentralized and anonymous voting application.  He showed us his amazing project and how he uses the Berty protocol in it. It was really great and we'll keep you posted for the next event and topic.
