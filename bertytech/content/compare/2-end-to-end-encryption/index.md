End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is intended to prevent data from being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). Unlike Telegram & Messenger, it's activated by default in the Berty app. 

🚀 **Benefits:**

- Data protection: no third parties can decipher the data being communicated or stored
- Prevents potential eavesdroppers including your telecom providers, your ISP and even us as providers of the communication service

🤨 **Cons:**

- It is not possible to inspect the content, even in the context of regulations and compliance.

 💪 **Associated Challenges:**

- Man-in-the-middle attacks
