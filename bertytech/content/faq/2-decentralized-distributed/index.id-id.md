A network is called **decentralized** when it doesn’t depend on a single entity, and thus does not pass through a central server where all of the resources are stored. A decentralized system gives the possibility to third parties to set up a server for a service and to transmit its data.

A **distributed** network does not rely on any server. It’s a P2P system. Peers who communicate with each other and exchange data over the network.

To learn more on the topic you can read the dedicated blogpost: [Centralized vs Decentralized vs Distributed Systems](/blog/decentralized-distributed-centralized/).
