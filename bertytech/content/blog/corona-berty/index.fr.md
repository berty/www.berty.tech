description: Berty during Covid-19
---

Today, COVID-19 needs no introduction. It has affected the lives of millions of people worldwide, and sadly, it's only the beginning of it. So let's have a thought here for all those people.

Particularly in Europe, since that is where we are based, and what we see around us today is unprecedented. Nobody wants it to become bigger than it is, so the governments took action. One of them is the ban on all air traffic, which several countries have put in place almost overnight. Many people are stranded thousands of miles away in foreign countries. And since then, the borders of the Schengen area have been closed and numerous containment measures have been taken (in Italy, Spain, France).

We have therefore decided, in accordance with the measures of the French government, that the Berty team will work exclusively from home.

We are more motivated than ever to deliver the Berty application to you. Internet and WiFi are often taken for granted, but this is not the case in many places at the best of times, and in a state of emergency, the chances of someone connecting are even lower. It is therefore particularly important to have a means of communication that does not rely on a network connection. It is important to be able to connect people to each other, and that the uncensored exchange of information is maintained during these crises.

We are going to open our repo very quickly, so that everyone can help Berty's fast development. If you are available, we will be more than happy to receive your contributions! We are committed to responding as quickly as possible. We will give you more details in an upcoming article. Stay tuned!

And what about you, our readers - has the situation impacted your personal life, your work, your projects?

[Let us know](https://berty.tech/contact/) how you are doing, and stay healthy!

Take care :)

The Berty team
