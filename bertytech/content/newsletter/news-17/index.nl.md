# Huidig werk

## Berty V2:
We keep on working on the new Berty. This week, we have finished defining the database models for Berty Protocol, as well as the internal proto of the different payloads and their envelopes.

## Gomobile-ipfs:
It's still in progress, but we continue working on the integration of gomobile on Berty. We hope to finish it asap 😉

## Ops
During the week, we worked on ParisP2P and FranceP2P. The website has been reorganized and new meetings events have been added. You can have a look here </br> 👉 https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/France-P2P/

We have integrated all our previous newsletters to the website. </br> 👉  https://berty.tech/newsletter
