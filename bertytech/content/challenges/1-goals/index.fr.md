* Provide a secure messenger that would preserve privacy and anonymity of its users
* Create a chat application that works over P2P network on desktop and mobile platforms
* Provide an easy to use Protocol, so that developers can create secure applications over P2P networks on desktop and mobile
* Improve the strengths and entropy of P2P networks by adding a lot of new peers
* Be able to do off-grid communication (offline-first)
* Be resilient against censorship
* Be resilient against mass surveillance by minimizing metadata leakage
* Being an alternative to the existing models powered by GAFAM or controlled/controllable by the government

In working towards those goals, Berty is facing certain challenges.
