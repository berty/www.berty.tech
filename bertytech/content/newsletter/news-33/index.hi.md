# News #33

Dear friends of the world,

Here we are, on the road for a 33rd newsletter! We've come a long way together. We'd like to warmly welcome new readers and thank the old ones. 🙂

Quick update about Covid19: At Berty, everyone's fine. We're all staying home until things get better. We really hope you're all doing well. Our whole team is particularly focused right now with a good mindset. Meanwhile, our interactions with the community have never been so strong and frequent. It's an awesome feeling! So, a big thank you for your many messages and interactions with us. Keep it up! We are thrilled you're sharing your positive energy with us.

Also worth a mention: we would like to give a big shout out to the **IPFS team** for getting in touch with us last week. These guys are really great. Thanks for their advice and help. A little nod to Juan & Molly, thanks again for your precious time! (_We know Molly is a regular reader of this newsletter and will read this for sure_).

All of this being said, happy reading & stay safe.


## 🗣️ Community

💥 The Berty community is officially opened!

We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, code owners, and privacy enthusiats. Today's priorities are mainly code-contributions and reviews to move the project forward. But non-code contributions are highly appreciated as well. 😉

All contributions ideas are listed in the Community page on our site: https://berty.tech/community

We hope you will find all the information you need to help us over there. If you don't, ping us!

Remember, there are no small contributions. There are only the ones you do! 🧡

**Important:** Join the community on [Discord](https://crpt.fyi/berty-discord)!

## 🚀 Open Source

Just in case you missed the information: we [officially announced](https://twitter.com/berty/status/1242870743802789888) the public opening of our GitHub repos last week!

The staff has been working hard to ensure this opening. It's always stressful to know that folks are going to be checking out every line of code. We're progressing on a lot of WIPs, but we decided to publish those as well.

Don't forget to click the ⭐ button on [Berty's GitHub page](https://github.com/berty/berty) to support us. (_No worries, this newsletter will keep you well updated!_ 😉)

## 🥖 Paris P2P #8: The first online edition!

Facing the lockdown in France, the Paris P2P team has decided to organize an online event for this eighth edition. The opportunity was too good, we had to be part of it!

Manfred did a talk called ['Last News from Berty'](https://p2p.paris/en/talks/last-news-from-berty/). He presented the opening of the community and the code - as well as a part of our short term roadmap. It's a great way to get an overview of Berty Chat and our vision of promoting ultra-available, secure, and decentralized communication.

We thank the whole Paris P2P team for coordinating our first 100% online meetup, streamed live on YouTube, Twitch, and D-Stream.

## 📚 Blogposts

As we mentioned in our previous [news](https://berty.tech/newsletter/news-32/), we opened our blog to external contributions. The first participant is our friend from Samourai Coop: Zooma. He honored us with two great blog posts. Please give him a big round of virtual applause!

👉 [How Berty could enable new forms of micro-local cooperation facing COVID-19?](https://berty.tech/blog/covid-local-cooperation/)

👉 [Watching 👁️: Mass surveillance status updated due to Corona Virus](https://berty.tech/blog/covid19-surveillance/)

The last one is part of a series that Zooma called 'Watching'. The concept is to monitor surveillance and alert the world on certain practices. We are delighted to see an engaged series published on our blog. We can't wait for the next one!

If, like Zooma, you are interested in publishing an article or two on our blog, please contact us. We'll be happy to help you do so!
