# News #56

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️

We hope you are doing well!

As usual, a little word about the team: everyone is fine. We were at our offsite last week. It was great to see each other. 🌞

You know what? Let's jump in! here is your dose of info on Berty.



## 🚀 Open Source

Here is our main focus of the past weeks:
* Improve OrbitDB: encrypt next links, optimize entry serialization and payload size
* Implement a Nearby driver for iOS
* Improve logging and reducing verbosity on the different variants of Berty (daemon, bot, etc...)
* Improve Tor transport and fix crashes that occurs on libp2p node restart
* Integrate gomobile-ipfs in Berty
* Continue tinder filtering and wiring on event bus, and add unit tests

### Offsite

A large part of the Berty team met last week for an off-site. It felt so good after a year of remote. So ok, we saw each other a bit at the office in Paris a while ago but this time, we could spend a whole week together and it's awesome. (Yes, we all had a PCR test to be safe).

We went in La Ciotat (near Marseille) in the south of France. It was sunny while it was snowing in Paris! Perfect timming!

We did a lot of games, swimming pool, sun, ping pong, pétanque, French gastromony and a little bit of work! 💯💯💯

In short, it was the opportunity to reconnect together and to be honest, it felt really good.

### New Discord Onboarding

**Small disclaimer:** We do not use Discord for support purposes. We use Discord simply because it is a convenient way to communicate with our community.

As we announced in our previous newsletter, we have updated our discord. The goal was to have a space that facilitates onboarding. In the longer term, there will be an automatic onboarding to the beta.

Check this out! And if you are not yet on our Discord, join us: https://discord.com/invite/vxPVdC9wjJ
