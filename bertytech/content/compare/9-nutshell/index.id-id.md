**[Berty](https://berty.tech/)** is a privacy-first messaging application built on top of [the Wesh Protocol](https://berty.tech/docs/protocol/).

- Secure and private :
    - Messages are end-to-end encrypted by default
    - Metadata is kept to a minimum
    - No phone number or email address is required to create an account
    - Built to retain its properties even when used on adversarial networks
- Censorship-resilient
    - Decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer, and serverless
    - No internet connection is required, thanks to [BLE technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).
- Open :
    - Free forever and open-source

**Berty** is designed to be used as an everyday messaging application. Nonetheless, it was built to primarily serve the following use cases:

- When you need to share sensitive information over untrusted networks, for instance, while traveling
- If you want to communicate anonymously
- If you want full control over your data and thus don't want to rely on third-party servers
- In countries that actively monitor and temper with their network, restricting its use and censoring some of its contents
- In areas with weak or no connection at all
