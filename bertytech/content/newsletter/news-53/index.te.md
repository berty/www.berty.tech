# News #53

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️


We've gotten a lot of new subscribers since [a Hacker News post on Wednesday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25926360) and in [Reddit/Open](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/l67i0g/berty_a_secure_peertopeer_messaging_app_that/) - thanks to those who published us! Welcome aboard if you're among them! The waters are choppy, and the stronger our crew, the better. (A special toast for the familiar faces from the early days is in order, too! 🍻)


As usual, quick update about the Berty team. We're doing well and working hard. We did some team-building at the beginning of the year (no trust falls of course 😁). #TeamNewYork. We're excited to see what comes from this extra momentum.


Happy reading and see you in two weeks :)

## 🗣️ Community

We'll say it again – we've got a lot of new subscribers and couldn't be happier. Our [GitHub](https://github.com/berty/Berty) stars have more than doubled.

The larger and more diverse our community and their needs+skillsets, the better Berty will be.

Several folks also hopped on to our Discord (come on in!) and compiled the code to test Berty. This gave rise to the kind of spontaneous, passionate conversation between strangers around the world that every digital revolutionary dreams of.

...Or just has fun in.
