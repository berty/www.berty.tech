  	      New instant messaging applications appear every day on the market. Each messenger has its own audience and its special features. Developers and application owners generally put commercial gains first, and criteria such as user anonymity and confidentiality are of secondary importance.

  	      However, in the post 9/11 era and since Snowdenâ€™s reveal, the world faces a sad reality: all citizens can be subjected to mass surveillance and, even worse, being censored. This is mainly the result of the use of central servers and the lack of data protection. All exchanges pass through the owner company's central server and the company can impose its own policies: accept or reject messages on a file on certain subjects, analyze them or even prohibit certain data. The owner company may be subject to government-initiated pressure, and they may be asked for backdoors to use all the information stored. This observation is the subject of many controversial debates with the common idea that national protection and defense give unlimited power over our private lives.
