# News #54

Ahoy Bertizen! 🏴‍☠️

We hope you are doing well!

Let's get it out of the way: How's your Bitcoin? We take this opportunity to place an ad: If anyone has the ear of Elon Musk, tell him to invest in Berty. Not necessarily 1.5 billion, but a few thousand-to-million (yanno, pocket change) would be welcome.

A short word about the team as usual: Everybody's doing well, working hard, firing on all cylinders, etc. Check out the highlights below for a breakdown!

Don't forget your Valentine this weekend. 💕

Cheers!
