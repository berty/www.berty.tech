## Huidig werk


First of all, you can update your version of Berty via Yolo. Our update platform has just been repaired. Sorry for the inconvenience.

* Yolo (Android)
* Yolo (iOS)

So, in a nutshell, the main topics of this week were:

* Cryptography-export declaration: Sent! We are waiting for feedbacks or accordance! May the god of crypto be with us 🎉 Live testing: We started our weekly user acceptance tests. Basically, three of us take an android phone, an iPhone and a computer and do the same exact tasks like adding a contact, deleting a group conversation, sending messages in plane mode, changing settings... We found some new bugs, we have works to do!
* Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): We are still working on iOS/Android compatibility. This is our big project. It takes time to do it well. We hope to progress quickly. We'll keep you informed!
* Push Notification: We're still working on push notifications (can be useful in a messenger app). This is an important challenge, especially when respecting the zero-knowledge. We started to open-source the 'zero push'. We're still doing a little cleaning in the code and we'll share it with you soon!

## Paris P2P #1


Paris P2P #1 took place last Wednesday, we had a blast! We talked about free internet, web3, IPFS, and much more stuff around a fresh draft beer 🍺🍕. Guys, if you're around next time, you should definitely join us! Just saying 🙃

## Vacation time!

 Don't worry if we don't give you too much news, we'll probably be under the sun ...  thinking of you 😇

We'll be in touch again on September 16th by email and in two weeks for our weekly newsletter - which we know you're looking forward to!
